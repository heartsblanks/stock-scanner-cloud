# Stock Scanner Cloud

Cloud-native trading workflow system for scanning markets, executing Alpaca paper trades, syncing state, analyzing performance, and visualizing results via a dashboard.

👉 See **ARCHITECTURE.md** for the full system design and current implementation status.

## ⚙️ Setup (local)

### 1. Clone
```bash
git clone https://github.com/heartsblanks/stock-scanner-cloud.git
cd stock-scanner-cloud
```

### 2. Python setup
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run backend
```bash
python app.py
```

API will be available at:
```
http://localhost:8080
```

---

## 🐳 Docker

```bash
docker build -t stock-scanner-cloud .
docker run -p 8080:8080 stock-scanner-cloud
```

---

## ☁️ Cloud Deployment

Deployed via **Google Cloud Build → Cloud Run** with a hosted PostgreSQL database on Neon.

The runtime container uses Gunicorn with an extended worker timeout so the post-close scheduler flow can complete longer reconciliation/export work without hitting the default 30-second worker abort.

```bash
gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/<PROJECT_ID>/stock-scanner

gcloud run deploy stock-scanner \
  --image gcr.io/<PROJECT_ID>/stock-scanner \
  --region europe-west1
```

## ⏱️ Scheduler Jobs

Cloud Scheduler triggers:

- market scans
- trade sync
- end-of-day close
- reconciliation
- analytics generation
- daily GitHub snapshot export

Recommended consolidated scheduler setup:

- `market-ops`
  - `5,15,25,35,45,55 9-15 * * 1-5 (America/New_York)`
  - Calls `POST /scheduler/market-ops`
  - Internally no-ops the early `9:05`, `9:15`, and `9:25` ticks, then runs sync and scheduled scans on the 10-minute offset cadence from `9:35` through `15:45`, including every `:55` tick, and uses the `15:55` tick for end-of-day close only
- `daily-post-close`
  - `30 16 * * 1-5 (America/New_York)`
  - Calls `POST /scheduler/daily-post-close`
  - Internally runs sync first, then reconciliation, trade analysis, signal analysis, and daily snapshot export
- `maintenance`
  - `0 18 * * * (America/New_York)`
  - Calls `POST /scheduler/maintenance`
  - Intended for periodic log pruning and future housekeeping tasks
- `ibkr-login-alert`
  - `*/10 9-16 * * 1-5 (America/New_York)`
  - Calls `POST /scheduler/ibkr-login-alert`
  - Only sends an alert when the IBKR bridge reports `LOGIN_REQUIRED` and Telegram alert credentials are configured

---

## 🔔 IBKR Login Alerts

The app can emit an IBKR login-required alert directly through a Telegram bot.

Required environment variables:

- `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`
- `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`
- `TELEGRAM_ALERT_DEDUP_MINUTES` (optional, defaults to `30`)

Important note:

- You need to create a Telegram bot once through `@BotFather`.
- You need to send at least one message to that bot from the destination chat before alerts can be delivered there.

## 📊 Dashboard

Located in:
```
dashboard-ui/
```

Run locally:
```bash
cd dashboard-ui
npm install
npm run dev
```

Features:
- summary metrics
- open trades
- lifecycle analytics
- charts (equity, symbol, mode, hourly)
- insights

---

## 💾 Database

Main tables:
- `signal_logs`
- `trade_events`
- `trade_lifecycles`
- `broker_orders`
- `reconciliation_runs`
- `reconciliation_details`
- `alpaca_api_logs`

Schema defined in:
```
schema.sql
```

---

## 🔁 Daily Snapshot Backup

Endpoint:
```
POST /export-daily-snapshot
```

Flow:
1. export reports + DB snapshots
2. clone GitHub repo
3. copy snapshot files
4. commit + push

Snapshots are DB-derived and no longer depend on operational `signals.csv` or `trades.csv` log files.
